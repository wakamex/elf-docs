### 2. Consolidated and Everlasting Liquidity

Previously, 6 month terms were deployed in a staggered manner. These staggered deployments lead to fragmented liquidity and required LPs to actively manage their position, rolling over their capital between different terms.

In Hyperdrive, terms are created on demand using the liquidity from a single pool. As a result, liquidity provision is no longer tied to a specific term. When a user provides liquidity, they do so for all future terms created from the pool. Their liquidity has no expiration. It is everlasting. The LP continues to collect fees on each trade as well as variable interest on unallocated capital, for as long as they wish.
